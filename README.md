Modernized data analytics, and advanced technologies for federal procurement
Code posted in accordance with Federal Open Source Policy (see code.gov).

Project includes two branches:
1. Code for analysis of structured contract transaction reports from USASpending.gov.
2. Code for natural language processing on contract documents and other supporting documents in government contract files.

Guiding Principles:

"Modular development", "share-first", "focus on reusuability" (see https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/procurement/guidance/modular-approaches-for-information-technology.pdf).

"Open standards", "participation in the open source community" (see https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf).

Foster cultural changes that promote innovation and managed risk taking through a continuous cycle of testing, obtaining feedback, sharing information, and retesting where appropriate (see the Promoting Rigorous and Innovative Cost Efficiencies for Federal Procurement and Acquisitions Act).

Pursuant to Section 5 of Executive Order (EO) 13960, "Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government", federal agencies are required to inventory their Artificial Intelligence (AI) use cases and share their inventories with other government agencies and the public. Include in agency source code inventory (e.g. Code.gov).
